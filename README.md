# React + Vite
React Router is a powerful library for managing navigation in React applications. It allows developers to define routes, enabling dynamic and nested views within a single-page application. React Router provides tools for handling route parameters and programmatically navigating users. This creates a seamless and responsive user experience without full page reloads.
